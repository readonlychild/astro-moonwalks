```

## GUILD_ID

The `id` of your Discord Server where **Moonwalker** has published Forum Threads.

## MOONWALK_MODE

One of `s3` (AWS S3 Bucket) or `fs` (filesystem). This should match how **Moonwalker** is serializing your forum threads.

This should point to the AWS Bucket (plus prefix) where **Moonwalker** saves the threads. Do NOT end it with `/`.

## FS_PATH

Required if `MOONWALK_MODE` is `fs`.

This should point to the directory where **Moonwalker** saves the threads, include the `records` folder but NO `/` at the end.
